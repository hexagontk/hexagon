# Project Site
The site is generated using [MkDocs] and uses [Google Analytics] for usage statistics. The MkDocs
theme used is [MkDocs Material].

Site generation requires [Python pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip) installed.

To generate the site you *MUST BUILD THE PROJECT* previously (`./gradlew build`), after that you can
use: `./gradlew buildSite` which executes: `mkdocs build -csq`.

To run the site inside a server for development, execute: `./gradlew serveSite`. The site will be
served at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). You can also build the site and serve the
`build` directory using: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.

The site properties are loaded from `mkdocs.yml` file. The content from `pages` is copied to
`build/content` in order to add the API Markdown to content.

The site takes the Dokka API generated by all modules and add it to the site.

Pages have a header with a button to edit the content in [GitHub].

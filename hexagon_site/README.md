# Project Site

To generate the site source, execute: `gw mkdocs` and for testing run:
`docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v $PWD/hexagon_site:/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material:4.6.2 serve`
the site will be served at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

The site uses [Google Analytics] for usage statistics.

The site properties are loaded from `mkdocs.yaml` file.

The content from `pages` is copied to `content` in order to add the API Markdown to content.

As `content` directory is created from `pages` processed content, it should be ignored by SCM and it
will be deleted by the clean task.

This site takes the Dokka API generated by all modules and add it to the site.

Pages have a header with a button to edit the content in [Github] and use [Disqus] to add comments
to each of them.

Toolkit Structure \u00b6 The project is composed by modules, each module provide a single functionality. There are three kind of modules: The ones that provide a functionality that does not depend on different implementations, like hexagon_scheduler or hexagon_core . Their name always start with the hexagon_ prefix. These modules can depend on several Ports, but never on Adapters (see below). Modules that define a \"Port\": these are interfaces to a feature that may have different implementations (ie: port_http_server or port_store ). They can not be used by themselves and in their place, an adapter implementing them should be added to the list of dependencies. These modules names start with the port_ prefix. Ports are independent from each other. Adapter modules, which are Port implementations for a given tool. store_mongodb and messaging_rabbitmq are examples of this type of modules. Adapter names must start with their port name. Hexagon Core \u00b6 The Hexagon Core module is used by all other libraries, so it would be added to your project anyway just by using any adapter. The main features it has are: Helpers : JVM information, a logger and other useful utilities. Dependency Injection : bind classes to creation closures or instances and inject them. Instance Serialization : parse/serialize data in different formats to class instances. Configuration Settings : load settings from different data sources and formats.

If no value is supplied, version 1.9.3 is taken. jacocoVersion: Jacoco code coverage tool version. Kotlin JS \u00b6 This script provides the following tasks for compiling Kotlin to JavaScript: jsAll : compiles the project to JavaScript including all of its dependencies. It copies all the resulting files to build/js . assembleWeb : copies all project resources and JavaScript files to build/web . IMPORTANT: This script must be applied at the end of the build script. To use it apply $gradleScripts/kotlin_js.gradle at the end of the build script, also apply the kotlin2js plugin. And finally, add the id 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm' version 'VERSION' plugin to the root build.gradle . Applying this script at the beginning won't work until it allows dependencies to be merged (a bug). To set up this script's parameters, check the build variables section . This helper settings are: javaScriptDirectory: JavaScript directory inside the web directory. By default, it is: \"js\". Application \u00b6 Gradle's script for a service or application. It adds two extra tasks: buildInfo: add configuration file ( application.properties ) with build variables to the package. watch: Run the application in another thread. This allows the possibility to watch source changes. To run the application and watch for changes you need to execute this task with the --continuous ( -t ) Gradle flag. Ie: gw -t watch .

Certificates \u00b6 Creates the required key stores for development purposes. IMPORTANT these key stores must not be used for production environments. The created key stores are: ca.p12 : self signed certificate authority (CA). This store holds the CA private key. The store must be private and will be used to sign other certificates. The key pair alias is ca . trust.p12 : key store with CA's public certificate. It can be set as the Java process trust store which make every certificate signed with the CA trusted. However, if used as the trust store, the JDK cacerts entries won't be loaded and thus, not trusted. It can be used to set up HTTPS clients (not required to be set at JVM level). <domain>.p12 : there would be one per each domain (see sslDomain variable). These stores are signed by the CA, and they contain the service private key and its full chain certificate. <domain> will be the domain name without the TLD, and the Subject alternative names (SAN) will include <domain>.test ( TLD for local environments ) and localhost (along the extra subdomains specified). The defined tasks are: createCa: creates ca.p12 and import its public certificate inside trust.p12 . createIdentities: creates the <domain>.p12 store for all sslDomain variables. To use it, apply $gradleScripts/certificates.gradle to your build.gradle . To set up this script's parameters, check the build variables section . This helper settings are: sslDomain[1-9] (REQUIRED): the main domain for the identity store. You can create up to ten (from sslDomain to sslDomain9 ). Each of these variables has the format subdomain1|subdomain2|subdomainN|domain.tld subdomains are added to <domain>.p12 alternative names (aside of <domain>.test and localhost which are always added). By default, no extra domains are added to the key store. sslOrganization (REQUIRED): organization stated in created certificates. sslCaFile: certificate authority key store file. By default: \"ca.p12\". sslCaAlias: CA alias in the key store. If not provided, it will be \"ca\". sslTrustFile: trust store file name, by default it is \"trust.p12\". sslPath: path used to generate the key stores. By default, it will be project's build directory. sslPassword: password used for the generated key stores. By default, it is the file name reversed. sslValidity: validity period (in days) for certificates. If not provided, it will be 365. sslCountry: country used in the certificates. By default, it is the current locale's country code. Lean \u00b6 This script changes the default Gradle source layout to be less bulky. To use it you must apply the $gradleScripts/lean.gradle script to your build.gradle file. It must be applied after the Kotlin plugin. After applying this script, the source folders will be ${ projectDir } /main and ${ projectDir } /test , and the resources will be stored also in these folders. TestNG \u00b6 Uses TestNG as the test framework. To use it, apply $gradleScripts/testng.gradle to your build.gradle . To set up this script's parameters, check the build variables section .

It is a default logger created for the System class (same as `Logger(System::class)`). \"\"\" } classLogger . trace { \"Message only evaluated if trace enabled at ${Jvm.id}\" } classLogger . debug { \"Message only evaluated if debug enabled at ${Jvm.id}\" } classLogger . warn { \"Message only evaluated if warn enabled at ${Jvm.id}\" } classLogger . info { \"Message only evaluated if info enabled at ${Jvm.id}\" } val exception = IllegalStateException ( \"Exception\" ) classLogger . warn ( exception ) { \"Warning with exception\" } classLogger . error ( exception ) { \"Error message with exception\" } classLogger . error { \"Error without an exception\" } classLogger . time ( \"Logs the time used to run the following block of code\" ) { val message = \"Block of code to be timed\" assert ( message . isNotBlank ()) } instanceLogger . flare { \"Prints a log that stands out for ease searching\" } Dependency injection \u00b6 You can take advantage of dependency injection using the InjectionManager object. You can bind supplier functions or objects to classes. If a class is already bound, later calls to bind* methods are ignored. However, you can use the forceBind* methods if you need to override a binding (in tests for example). Check this sample to bind constructor functions or objects to classes, and inject them later: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 // Bind classes to functions (create a different instance with each `inject` call) InjectionManager . bind < Date > { java . sql . Date ( System . currentTimeMillis ()) } // Bind classes to objects (returns the same instance for all `inject` calls) InjectionManager . bindObject < String >( \"STR\" ) // You can use labels to inject different instances InjectionManager . bindObject < String >( \"toolkit\" , \"Hexagon\" ) InjectionManager . bind < Date >( \"+1h\" ) { java . sql . Date ( System . currentTimeMillis () + 3 _600_000 ) } val currentSqlDate = InjectionManager . inject < Date >() val currentSqlDateInferredType : Date = InjectionManager . inject () // Inject different values for a class using tags (can be any type, not only string) val nextHourSqlDate : Date = InjectionManager . inject ( \"+1h\" ) val nextHourSqlDateInferredType : Date = InjectionManager . inject ( \"+1h\" ) // Injecting classes bound to objects return always the same instance val defaultString = InjectionManager . inject < String >() val taggedString : String = InjectionManager . inject ( \"toolkit\" ) // Overriding previously bound classes is not allowed (ignored) InjectionManager . bindObject < String >( \"STR Ignored\" ) val ignoredBinding = InjectionManager . inject < String >() // You can overwrite previously bound classes using `forceBind*` methods InjectionManager . forceBindObject < String >( \"STR Overridden\" ) val overriddenBinding = InjectionManager . inject < String >() Serialization \u00b6 The core module has utilities to serialize/parse data classes to JSON and YAML. Read the following snippet for details: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 val jason = Person ( \"Jason\" , \"Jackson\" , LocalDate . of ( 1989 , 12 , 31 )) val jasonJson = jason . serialize ( Json ) // Can also be Yaml or an string: \"application/json\" val parsedJason = jasonJson . parse ( Person :: class ) assert ( jason == parsedJason ) assert ( jason !== parsedJason ) Settings \u00b6 This module helps loading external settings from different sources. You can change the settings sources, the default ones are (bottom sources override top ones): Resource /service.yaml . Environment variables starting with SERVICE_ . System properties starting with service . File ./service.yaml from the application run directory. Resource /service_test.yaml . Below there is a code fragment showing how to add a custom settings source and load its properties: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 SettingsManager . settingsSources += ObjectSource ( \"stringProperty\" to \"str\" , \"integerProperty\" to 101 , \"booleanProperty\" to true ) assert ( SettingsManager . settings [ \"stringProperty\" ] == \"str\" ) assert ( SettingsManager . settings [ \"integerProperty\" ] == 101 ) assert ( SettingsManager . settings [ \"booleanProperty\" ] == true ) Package com.hexagonkt.helpers \u00b6 JVM information, a logger class and other useful utilities. Package com.hexagonkt.http \u00b6 HTTP code shared between clients and servers and independent of third party libraries. Package com.hexagonkt.injection \u00b6 Utilities to bind classes to creation closures or instances, and inject instances of those classes later. Package com.hexagonkt.serialization \u00b6 Parse/serialize data in different formats to class instances. Package com.hexagonkt.settings \u00b6 Load settings from different data sources and formats.","title":"Core"},{"location":"hexagon_core/hexagon_core/#module-hexagon_core","text":"This module holds utilities used in other libraries of the toolkit.

It defines a DSL to declare HTTP request handlers. Adapters implementing this port are responsible of transforming the DSL into a runtime. And allows you to switch implementations without changing the service. The hexagon_web module provides utilities on top of this port for Web application development (like templates helpers). Server \u00b6 A server is a process listening to HTTP requests on a TCP port. You can run multiple ones on different ports at the same time (this can be useful to test many microservices at the same time). The server can be configured with different properties. If you do not provide a value for them, they are searched inside the application settings and lastly, a default value is picked. This is the parameters list: serviceName: name of this service, it is only informative and it is displayed on the logs. If not set <undefined> is used. bindAddress: address to which this process is bound. If none is provided, 127.0.0.1 is taken. bindPort: the port that the process listens to. By default it is 2010 contextPath: initial path used for the rest of the routes, by default it is empty. You can inject an adapter for the Server port using the InjectionManager object: InjectionManager.bindObject<ServerPort>(JettyServletAdapter()) To create a server, you need to provide a router (check the next section for more information), and after creating a server you can run it or stop it with start and stop methods. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 /* * All settings are optional, you can supply any combination * Parameters not set will fall back to the defaults */ val settings = ServerSettings ( serverName = \"name\" , bindAddress = InetAddress . getByName ( \"0.0.0\" ), bindPort = 2020 , contextPath = \"/context\" ) val router = Router { get ( \"/hello\" ) { ok ( \"Hello World!\" ) } } val customServer = Server ( adapter , router , settings ) customServer . start () val customClient = Client ( AhcAdapter (), \"http://localhost:${customServer.runtimePort}\" ) assert ( customServer . started ()) assert ( customClient . get ( \"/context/hello\" ). body == \"Hello World!\" ) customServer . stop () /* * You can skip the adapter is you previously bound one * You may also skip the settings an the defaults will be used */ InjectionManager . bindObject ( adapter ) val defaultServer = Server ( router = router ) defaultServer . start () val defaultClient = Client ( AhcAdapter (), \"http://localhost:${defaultServer.runtimePort}\" ) assert ( defaultServer . started ()) assert ( defaultClient . get ( \"/hello\" ). body == \"Hello World!\" ) defaultServer . stop () Servlet Web server \u00b6 There is an special server adapter for running inside Servlet Containers. To use it you should import the Servlet HTTP Server Adapter into your project. Check the http_server_servlet module for more information. Routes \u00b6 The main building block of a Hexagon HTTP service is a set of routes. A route is made up of three simple pieces: A verb (get, post, put, delete, head, trace, connect, options). It can also be any . A path (/hello, /users/{name}). Paths must start with '/' and trailing slash is ignored. A callback code block. The callback has a void return type. You should use Call.send() to set the response which will be returned to the user. Routes are matched in the order they are defined. The first route that matches the request is invoked and the following ones are ignored. Check the next snippet for usage examples: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 get ( \"/hello\" ) { ok ( \"Get greeting\" )} put ( \"/hello\" ) { ok ( \"Put greeting\" )} post ( \"/hello\" ) { ok ( \"Post greeting\" )} any ( \"/hello\" ) { ok ( \"Fallback if HTTP verb was not used before\" )} get { ok ( \"Get at '/' if no route matched before\" ) } HTTP clients will be able to reuse the routes to create REST services clients. Route groups \u00b6 Routes can be nested by calling the path() method, which takes a String prefix and gives you a scope to declare routes and filters (or more nested paths). Ie: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 path ( \"/nested\" ) { get ( \"/hello\" ) { ok ( \"Greeting\" )} path ( \"/secondLevel\" ) { get ( \"/hello\" ) { ok ( \"Second level greeting\" )} } get { ok ( \"Get at '/nested'\" ) } } Routers \u00b6 If you have a lot of routes, it can be helpful to group them into routers. You can create routers to mount a group of routes in different paths (allowing you to reuse them). Check this snippet: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 fun personRouter ( kind : String ) = Router { get { ok ( \"Get $kind\" ) } put { ok ( \"Put $kind\" ) } post { ok ( \"Post $kind\" ) } } val server = Server ( adapter ) { path ( \"/clients\" , personRouter ( \"client\" )) path ( \"/customers\" , personRouter ( \"customer\" )) } Callbacks \u00b6 Callbacks are request's handling blocks that are bound to routes or filters. They make the request, response and session objects available to the handling code. Call \u00b6 The Call object provides you with everything you need to handle a http-request. It contains the underlying request and response, and a bunch of utility methods to return results, read parameters or pass attributes among filters/routes.

Don't parse body! 1 2 3 4 5 6 get ( \"/formParam\" ) { request . formParameters // the query param list request . formParameters [ \"FOO\" ] // value of FOO query param request . formParametersValues // the query param list request . formParametersValues [ \"FOO\" ] // all values of FOO query param } File Uploads \u00b6 Multipart Requests 1 2 3 4 post ( \"/file\" ) { val filePart = request . parts [ \"file\" ] ?: error ( \"File not available\" ) ok ( filePart . inputStream . reader (). readText ()) } Response \u00b6 Response information is provided by the response field: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 get ( \"/response\" ) { response . body // get response content response . body = \"Hello\" // sets content to Hello response . headers [ \"FOO\" ] = \"bar\" // sets header FOO with single value bar response . headersValues [ \"FOO\" ] = listOf ( \"bar\" ) // sets header FOO values with [ bar ] response . status // get the response status response . status = 401 // set status code to 401 response . contentType // get the content type response . contentType = \"text/xml\" // set content type to text/xml } Redirects \u00b6 You can redirect requests (returning 30x codes) by using Call utility methods: 1 2 3 get ( \"/redirect\" ) { redirect ( \"/call\" ) // browser redirect to /call } Cookies \u00b6 The request and response cookie functions provide a convenient way for sharing information between handlers, requests, or even servers. You can read client sent cookies from the request's cookies read only map. To change cookies or add new ones you have to use response.addCookie() and response.removeCookie() methods. Check the following sample code for details: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 get ( \"/cookie\" ) { request . cookies // get map of all request cookies request . cookies [ \"foo\" ] // access request cookie by name val cookie = HttpCookie ( \"new_foo\" , \"bar\" ) response . addCookie ( cookie ) // set cookie with a value cookie . maxAge = 3600 response . addCookie ( cookie ) // set cookie with a max-age cookie . secure = true response . addCookie ( cookie ) // secure cookie response . removeCookie ( \"foo\" ) // remove cookie } Sessions \u00b6 Every request has access to the session created on the server side, the session object provides the following methods: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 get ( \"/session\" ) { session // create and return session session . attributes [ \"user\" ] // Get session attribute 'user' session . set ( \"user\" , \"foo\" ) // Set session attribute 'user' session . removeAttribute ( \"user\" ) // Remove session attribute 'user' session . attributes // Get all session attributes session . id // Get session id session . isNew () // Check if session is new } Halting \u00b6 To immediately stop a request within a filter or route use halt() . halt() is not intended to be used inside exception-mappers. Check the following snippet for an example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 get ( \"/halt\" ) { halt () // halt with status 500 and stop route processing /* * These are just examples the following code will never be reached */ halt ( 401 ) // halt with status halt ( \"Body Message\" ) // halt with message (status 500) halt ( 401 , \"Go away!\" ) // halt with status and message } Filters \u00b6 You might know filters as interceptors, or middleware from other libraries. Filters are blocks of code executed before or after one or more routes. They can read the request and read/modify the response. All filters that match a route are executed in the order they are declared. Filters optionally take a pattern, causing them to be executed only if the request path matches that pattern. Before and after filters are always executed (if the route is matched). But any of them may stop the execution chain if halted. If halt() is called in one filter, filter processing is stopped for that kind of filter ( before or after ). In the case of before filters, this also prevent the route from being executed (but after filters are executed anyway). The following code details filters usage: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 before { response . headersValues [ \"b_all\" ] = listOf ( \"true\" ) } before ( \"/filters/*\" ) { response . headersValues [ \"b_filters\" ] = listOf ( \"true\" ) } get ( \"/filters/route\" ) { ok ( \"filters route\" ) } after ( \"/filters/*\" ) { response . headersValues [ \"a_filters\" ] = listOf ( \"true\" ) } get ( \"/filters\" ) { ok ( \"filters\" ) } path ( \"/nested\" ) { before { response . headersValues [ \"b_nested\" ] = listOf ( \"true\" ) } before ( \"/\" ) { response . headersValues [ \"b_nested_2\" ] = listOf ( \"true\" ) } get ( \"/filters\" ) { ok ( \"nested filters\" ) } get ( \"/halted\" ) { halt ( 499 , \"halted\" ) } get { ok ( \"nested also\" ) } after { response . headersValues [ \"a_nested\" ] = listOf ( \"true\" ) } } after { response . headersValues [ \"a_all\" ] = listOf ( \"true\" ) } Error Handling \u00b6 You can provide handlers for runtime errors. Errors are unhandled thrown exceptions in the callbacks, or handlers halted with an error code. Error handlers for a given code or exception are unique, and the first one defined is the one that will be used. HTTP Errors Handlers \u00b6 Allows to handle routes halted with a given code. These handlers are only applied if the route is halted, if the error code is returned with send it won't be handled as an error. Example: 1 2 3 4 5 // Register handler for routes halted with 512 code error ( 512 ) { send ( 500 , \"Ouch\" )} // If status code (512) is returned with `send` error won't be triggered get ( \"/errors\" ) { halt ( 512 ) } Exception Mapping \u00b6 You can handle exceptions of a given type for all routes and filters. The handler allows you to refer to the thrown exception. Look at the following code for a detailed example: 1 2 3 4 5 // Register handler for routes which callbacks throw exceptions error ( CodedException :: class ) { send ( 599 , it . message ?: \"empty\" ) } error ( IllegalStateException :: class ) { send ( 505 , it . message ?: \"empty\" ) } get ( \"/exceptions\" ) { error ( \"Message\" ) } get ( \"/codedExceptions\" ) { halt ( 509 , \"code\" ) } Static Files \u00b6 You can use a folder in the classpath for serving static files with the get() methods. Note that the public directory name is not included in the URL. Asset mapping is handled like any other route, so if an asset mapping is matched, no other route will be checked (assets or other routes). And also, if a previous route is matched, the asset mapping will never be checked. Being get(resource) a shortcut of get(\"/*\", resource) it should be placed as the last route. Check the next example for details: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 get ( \"/web/file.txt\" ) { ok ( \"It matches this route and won't search for the file\" ) } // Expose resources on the '/public' resource folder over the '/web' HTTP path get ( \"/web/*\" , Resource ( \"public\" )) // Maps resources on 'assets' on the server root (assets/f.css -> /f.css) // '/public/css/style.css' resource would be: 'http://{host}:{port}/css/style.css' get ( Resource ( \"assets\" )) MIME types \u00b6 The MIME types of static files are computed from the file extension using the SerializationManager.contentTypeOf method. CORS \u00b6 CORS behaviour can be different depending on the path. You can attach different CorsSettings to different routers. Check CorsSettings class for more details. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 val server : Server = Server ( adapter ) { corsPath ( \"/default\" , CorsSettings ()) corsPath ( \"/example/org\" , CorsSettings ( \"example.org\" )) corsPath ( \"/no/credentials\" , CorsSettings ( supportCredentials = false )) corsPath ( \"/only/post\" , CorsSettings ( allowedMethods = setOf ( POST ))) corsPath ( \"/cache\" , CorsSettings ( preFlightMaxAge = 10 )) corsPath ( \"/exposed/headers\" , CorsSettings ( exposedHeaders = setOf ( \"head\" ))) corsPath ( \"/allowed/headers\" , CorsSettings ( allowedHeaders = setOf ( \"head\" ))) } private fun Router . corsPath ( path : String , settings : CorsSettings ) { path ( path ) { // CORS settings can change for different routes cors ( settings ) get ( \"/path\" ) { ok ( request . method ) } post ( \"/path\" ) { ok ( request . method ) } put ( \"/path\" ) { ok ( request . method ) } delete ( \"/path\" ) { ok ( request . method ) } get { ok ( request . method ) } post { ok ( request . method ) } put { ok ( request . method ) } delete { ok ( request . method ) } } } HTTPS \u00b6 It is possible to start a secure server enabling HTTPS. For this, you have to provide a server certificate and its key in the server's SslSettings . Once you use a server certificate, it is also possible to serve content using HTTP/2 , for this to work, ALPN is required (however, this is already handled if you use Java 11). The certificate common name should match the host that will serve the content in order to be accepted by an HTTP client without a security error. There is a Gradle helper to create sample certificates for development purposes. HTTP clients can also be configured to use a certificate. This is required to implement a double ended authorization ( mutual TLS ). This is also done by passing a SslSettings object the the HTTP client. If you want to implement mutual trust, you must enforce client certificate in the server configuration (check SslSettings.clientAuth ). If this is done, you can access the certificate the client used to connect (assuming it is valid, if not the connection will end with an error) with the Request.certificateChain property. Below you can find a simple example to set up an HTTPS server and client with mutual TLS: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 // Key store files val identity = \"hexagonkt.p12\" val trust = \"trust.p12\" // Default passwords are file name reversed val keyStorePassword = identity . reversed () val trustStorePassword = trust . reversed () // Key stores can be set as URIs to classpath resources (the triple slash is needed) val keyStore = URI ( \"resource:///ssl/$identity\" ) val trustStore = URI ( \"resource:///ssl/$trust\" ) val sslSettings = SslSettings ( keyStore = keyStore , keyStorePassword = keyStorePassword , trustStore = trustStore , trustStorePassword = trustStorePassword , clientAuth = true // Requires a valid certificate from the client (mutual TLS) ) val serverSettings = ServerSettings ( bindPort = 0 , protocol = HTTPS , // You can also use HTTP2 sslSettings = sslSettings ) val server = serve ( serverSettings , serverAdapter ) { get ( \"/hello\" ) { // We can access the certificate used by the client from the request val subjectDn = request . certificate ?. subjectDN ?. name response . headers [ \"cert\" ] = subjectDn ok ( \"Hello World!\" ) } } // We'll use the same certificate for the client (in a real scenario it would be different) val clientSettings = ClientSettings ( sslSettings = sslSettings ) // Create a HTTP client and make a HTTPS request val client = Client ( AhcAdapter (), \"https://localhost:${server.runtimePort}\" , clientSettings ) client . get ( \"/hello\" ). apply { logger . debug { body } // Assure the certificate received (and returned) by the server is correct assert ( headers . require ( \"cert\" ). first (). startsWith ( \"CN=hexagonkt.com\" )) assert ( body == \"Hello World!\" ) } Testing \u00b6 Integration tests \u00b6 To test HTTP servers from outside using a real Adapter, you can create a server setting 0 as port. This will pick a random free port that you can check later: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 val router = Router { get ( \"/hello\" ) { ok ( \"Hi!\" ) } } val serverSettings = ServerSettings ( \"name\" , InetAddress . getLoopbackAddress (), 0 ) val server = Server ( adapter , router , serverSettings ) server . start () val client = Client ( AhcAdapter (), \"http://localhost:${server.runtimePort}\" ) assert ( client . get ( \"/hello\" ). body == \"Hi!\" ) server . stop () To do this kind of tests without creating a custom server (using the real production code). Check the tests of the starter projects . Mocking calls \u00b6 To unit test callbacks you can create test calls with hardcoded requests, responses and sessions. To use it in your project you'll have to include a dependency (with test scope): build.gradle 1 testImplementation ( \"com.hexagonkt:port_http_server:$hexagonVersion:test\" ) pom.xml 1 2 3 4 5 6 <dependency> <groupId> com.hexagonkt </groupId> <artifactId> port_http_server </artifactId> <version> $hexagonVersion </version> <scope> test </scope> </dependency> Check testCall , TestRequest , TestResponse and TestSession for more details.

It defines a DSL to declare HTTP request handlers. Adapters implementing this port are responsible of transforming the DSL into a runtime. And allows you to switch implementations without changing the service. The hexagon_web module provides utilities on top of this port for Web application development (like templates helpers). Server \u00b6 A server is a process listening to HTTP requests on a TCP port. You can run multiple ones on different ports at the same time (this can be useful to test many microservices at the same time). The server can be configured with different properties. If you do not provide a value for them, they are searched inside the application settings and lastly, a default value is picked. This is the parameters list: serviceName: name of this service, it is only informative and it is displayed on the logs. If not set <undefined> is used. bindAddress: address to which this process is bound. If none is provided, 127.0.0.1 is taken. bindPort: the port that the process listens to. By default it is 2010 contextPath: initial path used for the rest of the routes, by default it is empty. You can inject an adapter for the Server port using the InjectionManager object: InjectionManager.bindObject<ServerPort>(JettyServletAdapter()) To create a server, you need to provide a router (check the next section for more information), and after creating a server you can run it or stop it with start() and stop() methods. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 /* * All settings are optional, you can supply any combination * Parameters not set will fall back to the defaults */ val settings = ServerSettings ( serverName = \"name\" , bindAddress = InetAddress . getByName ( \"0.0.0\" ), bindPort = 2020 , contextPath = \"/context\" ) val router = Router { get ( \"/hello\" ) { ok ( \"Hello World!\" ) } } val customServer = Server ( adapter , router , settings ) customServer . start () val customClient = Client ( AhcAdapter (), \"http://localhost:${customServer.runtimePort}\" ) assert ( customServer . started ()) assert ( customClient . get ( \"/context/hello\" ). body == \"Hello World!\" ) customServer . stop () /* * You can skip the adapter is you previously bound one * You may also skip the settings an the defaults will be used */ InjectionManager . bindObject ( adapter ) val defaultServer = Server ( router = router ) defaultServer . start () val defaultClient = Client ( AhcAdapter (), \"http://localhost:${defaultServer.runtimePort}\" ) assert ( defaultServer . started ()) assert ( defaultClient . get ( \"/hello\" ). body == \"Hello World!\" ) defaultServer . stop () Servlet Web server \u00b6 There is an special server adapter for running inside Servlet Containers. To use it you should import the Servlet HTTP Server Adapter into your project. Check the http_server_servlet module for more information. Routes \u00b6 The main building block of a Hexagon HTTP service is a set of routes. A route is made up of three simple pieces: A verb (get, post, put, delete, head, trace, connect, options). It can also be any . A path (/hello, /users/{name}). Paths must start with '/' and trailing slash is ignored. A callback code block. The callback has a void return type. You should use Call.send() to set the response which will be returned to the user. Routes are matched in the order they are defined. The first route that matches the request is invoked and the following ones are ignored. Check the next snippet for usage examples: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 get ( \"/hello\" ) { ok ( \"Get greeting\" )} put ( \"/hello\" ) { ok ( \"Put greeting\" )} post ( \"/hello\" ) { ok ( \"Post greeting\" )} any ( \"/hello\" ) { ok ( \"Fallback if HTTP verb was not used before\" )} get { ok ( \"Get at '/' if no route matched before\" ) } HTTP clients will be able to reuse the routes to create REST services clients. Route groups \u00b6 Routes can be nested by calling the path() method, which takes a String prefix and gives you a scope to declare routes and filters (or more nested paths). Ie: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 path ( \"/nested\" ) { get ( \"/hello\" ) { ok ( \"Greeting\" )} path ( \"/secondLevel\" ) { get ( \"/hello\" ) { ok ( \"Second level greeting\" )} } get { ok ( \"Get at '/nested'\" ) } } Routers \u00b6 If you have a lot of routes, it can be helpful to group them into routers. You can create routers to mount a group of routes in different paths (allowing you to reuse them). Check this snippet: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 fun personRouter ( kind : String ) = Router { get { ok ( \"Get $kind\" ) } put { ok ( \"Put $kind\" ) } post { ok ( \"Post $kind\" ) } } val server = Server ( adapter ) { path ( \"/clients\" , personRouter ( \"client\" )) path ( \"/customers\" , personRouter ( \"customer\" )) } Callbacks \u00b6 Callbacks are request's handling blocks that are bound to routes or filters. They make the request, response and session objects available to the handling code. Call \u00b6 The Call object provides you with everything you need to handle a http-request. It contains the underlying request and response, and a bunch of utility methods to return results, read parameters or pass attributes among filters/routes. The methods are available directly from the callback ( Call is the callback receiver). You can check the API documentation for the full list of methods. This sample code illustrates the usage: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 get ( \"/call\" ) { attributes // the attributes list attributes [ \"foo\" ] // value of foo attribute attributes [ \"A\" ] = \"V\" // sets value of attribute A to V ok ( \"Response body\" ) // returns a 200 status send ( 400 , \"Invalid request\" ) // returns any status } Request \u00b6 Request functionality is provided by the request field: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 get ( \"/request\" ) { // URL Information request . method // the HTTP method (GET, ..etc) request . scheme // http or https request . secure // true if scheme is https request . host // the host, e.g. \"example.com\" request . ip // client IP address request . port // the server port request . path // the request path, e.g. /result.jsp request . body // request body sent by the client request . url // the url. e.g. \"http://example.com/foo\" // Headers request . headers // the HTTP header list with first values only request . headers [ \"BAR\" ] // first value of BAR header request . headersValues // the HTTP header list with their full values list request . headersValues [ \"BAR\" ] // list of values of BAR header // Common headers shortcuts request . contentType // content type of request.body request . acceptValues // Client accepted content types request . userAgent // user agent (browser requests) request . origin // origin (browser requests) // Parameters request . pathParameters // map with all path parameters request . formParameters // map with first values of all form fields request . formParametersValues // map with all form fields values request . queryParameters // map with first values of all query parameters request . queryParametersValues // map with all query parameters values // Body processing request . contentLength // length of request body request . body ( Type :: class ) // Object passed in the body as a typed object request . body < Type >() // Syntactic sugar for the previous statement request . bodyObjects ( Type :: class ) // Object(s) passed in the body as a typed list request . bodyObjects < Type >() // Syntactic sugar for the previous statement request . body ( Map :: class ) // Object passed in the body as a field map request . body < Map <*, *>>() // Syntactic sugar for the previous statement request . bodyObjects ( Map :: class ) // Object(s) passed in the body as a list of maps request . bodyObjects < Map <*, *>>() // Syntactic sugar for the previous statement } Path Parameters \u00b6 Route patterns can include named parameters, accessible via the pathParameters map on the request object: 1 2 3 4 get ( \"/pathParam/{foo}\" ) { request . pathParameters [ \"foo\" ] // value of foo path parameter request . pathParameters // map with all parameters } Query Parameters \u00b6 It is possible to access the whole query string or only an specific query parameter using the parameters map on the request object: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 get ( \"/queryParam\" ) { request . queryString request . queryParameters // the query param list request . queryParameters [ \"FOO\" ] // value of FOO query param request . queryParametersValues // the query param list request . queryParametersValues [ \"FOO\" ] // all values of FOO query param } Form Parameters \u00b6 HTML Form processing. Don't parse body! 1 2 3 4 5 6 get ( \"/formParam\" ) { request . formParameters // the query param list request . formParameters [ \"FOO\" ] // value of FOO query param request . formParametersValues // the query param list request . formParametersValues [ \"FOO\" ] // all values of FOO query param } File Uploads \u00b6 Multipart Requests 1 2 3 4 post ( \"/file\" ) { val filePart = request . parts [ \"file\" ] ?: error ( \"File not available\" ) ok ( filePart . inputStream . reader (). readText ()) } Response \u00b6 Response information is provided by the response field: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 get ( \"/response\" ) { response . body // get response content response . body = \"Hello\" // sets content to Hello response . headers [ \"FOO\" ] = \"bar\" // sets header FOO with single value bar response . headersValues [ \"FOO\" ] = listOf ( \"bar\" ) // sets header FOO values with [ bar ] response . status // get the response status response . status = 401 // set status code to 401 response . contentType // get the content type response . contentType = \"text/xml\" // set content type to text/xml } Redirects \u00b6 You can redirect requests (returning 30x codes) by using Call utility methods: 1 2 3 get ( \"/redirect\" ) { redirect ( \"/call\" ) // browser redirect to /call } Cookies \u00b6 The request and response cookie functions provide a convenient way for sharing information between handlers, requests, or even servers. You can read client sent cookies from the request's cookies read only map. To change cookies or add new ones you have to use response.addCookie() and response.removeCookie() methods. Check the following sample code for details: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 get ( \"/cookie\" ) { request . cookies // get map of all request cookies request . cookies [ \"foo\" ] // access request cookie by name val cookie = HttpCookie ( \"new_foo\" , \"bar\" ) response . addCookie ( cookie ) // set cookie with a value cookie . maxAge = 3600 response . addCookie ( cookie ) // set cookie with a max-age cookie . secure = true response . addCookie ( cookie ) // secure cookie response . removeCookie ( \"foo\" ) // remove cookie } Sessions \u00b6 Every request has access to the session created on the server side, the session object provides the following methods: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 get ( \"/session\" ) { session // create and return session session . attributes [ \"user\" ] // Get session attribute 'user' session . set ( \"user\" , \"foo\" ) // Set session attribute 'user' session . removeAttribute ( \"user\" ) // Remove session attribute 'user' session . attributes // Get all session attributes session . id // Get session id session . isNew () // Check if session is new } Halting \u00b6 To immediately stop a request within a filter or route use halt() . halt() is not intended to be used inside exception-mappers. Check the following snippet for an example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 get ( \"/halt\" ) { halt () // halt with status 500 and stop route processing /* * These are just examples the following code will never be reached */ halt ( 401 ) // halt with status halt ( \"Body Message\" ) // halt with message (status 500) halt ( 401 , \"Go away!\" ) // halt with status and message } Filters \u00b6 You might know filters as interceptors, or middleware from other libraries. Filters are blocks of code executed before or after one or more routes. They can read the request and read/modify the response. All filters that match a route are executed in the order they are declared. Filters optionally take a pattern, causing them to be executed only if the request path matches that pattern. Before and after filters are always executed (if the route is matched). But any of them may stop the execution chain if halted. If halt() is called in one filter, filter processing is stopped for that kind of filter ( before or after ). In the case of before filters, this also prevent the route from being executed (but after filters are executed anyway). The following code details filters usage: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 before { response . headersValues [ \"b_all\" ] = listOf ( \"true\" ) } before ( \"/filters/*\" ) { response . headersValues [ \"b_filters\" ] = listOf ( \"true\" ) } get ( \"/filters/route\" ) { ok ( \"filters route\" ) } after ( \"/filters/*\" ) { response . headersValues [ \"a_filters\" ] = listOf ( \"true\" ) } get ( \"/filters\" ) { ok ( \"filters\" ) } path ( \"/nested\" ) { before { response . headersValues [ \"b_nested\" ] = listOf ( \"true\" ) } before ( \"/\" ) { response . headersValues [ \"b_nested_2\" ] = listOf ( \"true\" ) } get ( \"/filters\" ) { ok ( \"nested filters\" ) } get ( \"/halted\" ) { halt ( 499 , \"halted\" ) } get { ok ( \"nested also\" ) } after { response . headersValues [ \"a_nested\" ] = listOf ( \"true\" ) } } after { response . headersValues [ \"a_all\" ] = listOf ( \"true\" ) } Error Handling \u00b6 You can provide handlers for runtime errors. Errors are unhandled thrown exceptions in the callbacks, or handlers halted with an error code. Error handlers for a given code or exception are unique, and the first one defined is the one that will be used. HTTP Errors Handlers \u00b6 Allows to handle routes halted with a given code. These handlers are only applied if the route is halted, if the error code is returned with send it won't be handled as an error. Example: 1 2 3 4 5 // Register handler for routes halted with 512 code error ( 512 ) { send ( 500 , \"Ouch\" )} // If status code (512) is returned with `send` error won't be triggered get ( \"/errors\" ) { halt ( 512 ) } Exception Mapping \u00b6 You can handle exceptions of a given type for all routes and filters. The handler allows you to refer to the thrown exception. Look at the following code for a detailed example: 1 2 3 4 5 // Register handler for routes which callbacks throw exceptions error ( CodedException :: class ) { send ( 599 , it . message ?: \"empty\" ) } error ( IllegalStateException :: class ) { send ( 505 , it . message ?: \"empty\" ) } get ( \"/exceptions\" ) { error ( \"Message\" ) } get ( \"/codedExceptions\" ) { halt ( 509 , \"code\" ) } Static Files \u00b6 You can use a folder in the classpath for serving static files with the get() methods. Note that the public directory name is not included in the URL. Asset mapping is handled like any other route, so if an asset mapping is matched, no other route will be checked (assets or other routes). And also, if a previous route is matched, the asset mapping will never be checked. Being get(resource) a shortcut of get(\"/*\", resource) it should be placed as the last route. Check the next example for details: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 get ( \"/web/file.txt\" ) { ok ( \"It matches this route and won't search for the file\" ) } // Expose resources on the '/public' resource folder over the '/web' HTTP path get ( \"/web/*\" , Resource ( \"public\" )) // Maps resources on 'assets' on the server root (assets/f.css -> /f.css) // '/public/css/style.css' resource would be: 'http://{host}:{port}/css/style.css' get ( Resource ( \"assets\" )) MIME types \u00b6 The MIME types of static files are computed from the file extension using the SerializationManager.contentTypeOf() method. CORS \u00b6 CORS behaviour can be different depending on the path. You can attach different CorsSettings to different routers. Check CorsSettings class for more details. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 val server : Server = Server ( adapter ) { corsPath ( \"/default\" , CorsSettings ()) corsPath ( \"/example/org\" , CorsSettings ( \"example.org\" )) corsPath ( \"/no/credentials\" , CorsSettings ( supportCredentials = false )) corsPath ( \"/only/post\" , CorsSettings ( allowedMethods = setOf ( POST ))) corsPath ( \"/cache\" , CorsSettings ( preFlightMaxAge = 10 )) corsPath ( \"/exposed/headers\" , CorsSettings ( exposedHeaders = setOf ( \"head\" ))) corsPath ( \"/allowed/headers\" , CorsSettings ( allowedHeaders = setOf ( \"head\" ))) } private fun Router . corsPath ( path : String , settings : CorsSettings ) { path ( path ) { // CORS settings can change for different routes cors ( settings ) get ( \"/path\" ) { ok ( request . method ) } post ( \"/path\" ) { ok ( request . method ) } put ( \"/path\" ) { ok ( request . method ) } delete ( \"/path\" ) { ok ( request . method ) } get { ok ( request . method ) } post { ok ( request . method ) } put { ok ( request . method ) } delete { ok ( request . method ) } } } HTTPS \u00b6 It is possible to start a secure server enabling HTTPS.
